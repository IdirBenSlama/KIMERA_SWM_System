### Processing Pipeline

1. **Client Request** is sent to the API layer.
2. The **Integration Layer** validates input and selects engines.
3. **Engines** compute results and interact with **Core** services.
4. Outcomes are persisted while metrics feed the monitoring stack.
5. The API layer formats and returns the final response.

## Key Scientific Components

### Thermodynamic Engine

The Thermodynamic Engine implements entropy calculations for cognitive states and energy conservation tracking in cognitive transitions. It models cognitive processes as thermodynamic systems with entropy, energy, and heat dissipation.

```python
def calculate_state_entropy(cognitive_state):
    """Calculate the entropy of a cognitive state."""
    probabilities = extract_probabilities(cognitive_state)
    return -sum(p * np.log2(p) for p in probabilities if p > 0)
```

### Quantum Field Engine

The Quantum Field Engine implements quantum mechanical principles for cognitive modeling, including superposition, entanglement, and measurement operations.

```python
def superposition(state_a, state_b, alpha=0.5):
    """Create a superposition of two quantum states."""
    alpha_sqrt = np.sqrt(alpha)
    beta_sqrt = np.sqrt(1 - alpha)
    return alpha_sqrt * state_a + beta_sqrt * state_b
```

### SPDE Engine

The SPDE (Stochastic Partial Differential Equation) Engine implements diffusion processes for cognitive modeling, including stochastic differential equation solvers and conservation law enforcement.

```python
def evolve(field, dt=0.01, steps=1):
    """Evolve a field according to a stochastic diffusion equation."""
    current_field = field.copy()
    
    for _ in range(steps):
        # Diffusion term
        laplacian = calculate_laplacian(current_field)
        diffusion_term = diffusion_constant * laplacian * dt
        
        # Noise term
        noise = np.random.normal(0, noise_amplitude, size=field.shape) * np.sqrt(dt)
        
        # Update field
        current_field += diffusion_term + noise
        
    return current_field
```

### Portal/Vortex Engine

The Portal/Vortex Engine implements interdimensional navigation for cognitive modeling, including portal creation between cognitive spaces and dimensional transition modeling.

## Database Architecture

The system uses PostgreSQL 15.12 with the pgvector extension for high-dimensional vector operations. The database schema includes:

- **GeoidState**: Represents cognitive states as high-dimensional vectors
- **CognitiveTransition**: Represents transitions between cognitive states
- **SemanticEmbedding**: Stores text embeddings for semantic operations
- **PortalConfiguration**: Stores configurations for interdimensional portals
- **SystemMetric**: Records system performance metrics

The database connection manager implements multiple authentication strategies and graceful fallback mechanisms:

1. **Primary Strategy**: Kimera-specific credentials
2. **Secondary Strategy**: Environment variable configuration
3. **Tertiary Strategy**: SQLite fallback for development
