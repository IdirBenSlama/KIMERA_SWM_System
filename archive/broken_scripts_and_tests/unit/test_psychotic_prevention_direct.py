Direct Unit Test for Psychotic Feature Prevention Monitor
=========================================================

This test validates the PsychoticFeaturePrevention monitor's logic directly,
bypassing the server.

Methodology:
- Imports the PsychoticFeaturePrevention class directly.
- Crafts tensors to represent:
    - Reality-Grounded vs. Detached states
    - Organized vs. Disorganized thought patterns
- Calls the monitor's methods in-memory.
- Asserts the correctness of the returned scores.
