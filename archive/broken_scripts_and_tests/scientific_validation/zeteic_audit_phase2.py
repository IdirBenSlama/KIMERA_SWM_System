"""
Zeteic Audit for KIMERA Phase 2 Cognitive Architecture
=====================================================

This test suite adopts a skeptical, rigorous, and scientific mindset to
validate the claims of the Phase 2 implementation. It does not assume
components work as described, but seeks empirical, statistically-backed
evidence.

Methodology:
- Formulates a null hypothesis for each feature (e.g., "the feature has no effect").
- Conducts experiments to gather data from the live API.
- Uses statistical analysis (correlation, significance testing) to reject or
  fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- Provides a clear, evidence-based "Zeteic Verdict" for each component.
