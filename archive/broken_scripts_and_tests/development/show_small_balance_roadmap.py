â€¢ Average Risk/Reward: 1:2
â€¢ Max Concurrent Positions: 2
â€¢ Confidence Threshold: 70%+


âœ… GOLDEN RULES FOR SUCCESS
===========================

1. NEVER risk more than 1% per trade
2. Wait for Kimera confidence > 70%
3. Stop trading after 2% daily profit
4. Maximum 2 positions at once
5. Document every trade for learning
6. Trust the process, not emotions


ðŸ’¡ THE MATH BEHIND SUCCESS
==========================

Starting: $341.97
Daily Growth: 2% (conservative target)
Compound Factor: (1.02)^n where n = days

Examples:
- 30 days: $341.97 Ã— 1.02^30 = $619.72
- 60 days: $341.97 Ã— 1.02^60 = $1,141.51
- 90 days: $341.97 Ã— 1.02^90 = $2,102.49
- 120 days: $341.97 Ã— 1.02^120 = $3,876.07

To reach $10,000:
Required days = log(10000/341.97) / log(1.02) â‰ˆ 169 days


ðŸš€ ACTION PLAN
==============

1. Start with BTCUSD and ETHUSD only (most liquid)
2. Trade during optimal sessions:
   - Asian: 00:00-04:00 UTC
   - European: 08:00-12:00 UTC
   - US: 14:00-18:00 UTC

3. Position sizing for $341.97:
