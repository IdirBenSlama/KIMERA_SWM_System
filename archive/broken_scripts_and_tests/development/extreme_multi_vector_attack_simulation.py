Extreme Multi-Vector Attack Simulation
=====================================

NO MERCY - FULL ASSAULT ON KIMERA'S GYROSCOPIC EQUILIBRIUM

This simulation throws everything at KIMERA simultaneously:
- Prompt injection floods
- Authority hijacking attempts  
- Emotional manipulation campaigns
- Context poisoning streams
- Cognitive overload attacks
- Social engineering waves
- Boundary breach attempts
- Consistency attack volleys
- Network flooding
- API exploitation
- Memory tampering simulation
- Behavioral manipulation
- Ethical constraint bypass attempts

Let's see if the gyroscopic sphere can maintain equilibrium
under this relentless multi-dimensional assault.
