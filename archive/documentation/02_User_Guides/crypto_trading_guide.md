# Kimera Crypto Trading Guide

## Overview

The Kimera Crypto Trading system demonstrates how cognitive field dynamics, contradiction detection, and semantic thermodynamics can be applied to real-time cryptocurrency trading. This plugin leverages Kimera's unique cognitive capabilities to analyze market conditions and make trading decisions under extreme volatility.

## Key Features

### 1. Cognitive Market Analysis
- **Cognitive Field Generation**: Analyzes market data through Kimera's cognitive lens
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies market inefficiencies and arbitrage opportunities
- **Semantic Temperature**: Measures market "heat" to detect overheated or undervalued conditions
- **Insight Generation**: Produces actionable trading signals from cognitive analysis

### 2. Real-Time Decision Making
- **High-Pressure Performance**: Designed for crypto's extreme volatility
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Combines cognitive pressure, contradictions, and temperature
- **Confidence-Based Sizing**: Position sizes scale with decision confidence
- **Risk Management**: Built-in stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms

### 3. Performance Tracking
- **Cognitive Accuracy**: Measures how well cognitive analysis predicts outcomes
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and drawdown analysis
- **Decision Attribution**: Tracks which cognitive factors drive performance

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file with your API credentials
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_testnet_api_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_testnet_api_secret
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Always use testnet for testing! Get testnet keys from https://testnet.binance.vision/

### 2. Run the Demo

```bash
python examples/crypto_trading_demo.py
```

### 3. Configuration

Edit `config/trading_config.json` to customize:
- Trading symbols
- Risk parameters
- Cognitive thresholds
- Update intervals

## Trading Logic

### Market State Analysis

The system analyzes each market through multiple cognitive lenses:

1. **Cognitive Pressure** (0-1)
   - High (>0.7): Market uncertainty, reduce positions
   - Low (<0.3): Clear patterns, increase confidence

2. **Contradiction Level** (0-1)
   - High (>0.6): Market inefficiencies, trading opportunities
   - Low (<0.3): Efficient market, fewer opportunities

3. **Semantic Temperature** (0-1)
   - Hot (>0.8): Overheated market, potential reversal
   - Cold (<0.2): Undervalued, accumulation phase

### Decision Making

Trading decisions combine multiple factors:

```python
decision_score = Σ(factor_weight × factor_value)

if decision_score > 0.3 and no_position:
    BUY
elif decision_score < -0.3 and has_position:
    SELL
else:
    HOLD
```

### Position Sizing

Uses modified Kelly Criterion with cognitive adjustments:

```python
position_size = base_risk × confidence × (1 / (1 + volatility))
```

## Risk Management

### Built-in Safeguards

1. **Position Limits**
   - Max 10% per position
   - Max 3 concurrent positions
   - Daily loss limit: 5%

2. **Stop Loss & Take Profit**
   - Stop loss: 2× volatility
   - Take profit: 3× volatility × confidence

3. **Circuit Breakers**
   - Pause trading if daily loss exceeded
   - Stop if cognitive pressure too high

## Performance Metrics

### Real-Time Tracking

```json
{
    "total_pnl": 523.45,
    "win_rate": 62.5,
    "sharpe_ratio": 1.85,
    "cognitive_accuracy": 0.73,
    "best_conditions": {
        "contradiction_level": ">0.6",
        "temperature": "<0.3"
    }
}
```

### Cognitive Performance Analysis

The system tracks which cognitive factors lead to profitable trades:

- **High Confidence Success Rate**: Measures if high-confidence trades perform well
- **Condition Analysis**: Identifies market conditions that work best
- **Decision Attribution**: Shows which factors contributed to each decision

## API Integration

### Supported Exchanges

Currently supports Binance (spot trading). The architecture allows easy addition of other exchanges.

### WebSocket Streams

Real-time data streams:
- Ticker updates
- Order book depth
- Trade executions
- Account updates

### Rate Limiting

Respects exchange limits:
- 1200 requests/minute
- 10 WebSocket connections
- Automatic retry with backoff

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Strategies

Extend the base trading engine:

```python
class MyCustomStrategy(KimeraTradingEngine):
    async def make_trading_decision(self, symbol, market_state, portfolio):
        # Your custom logic here
        decision = await super().make_trading_decision(
            symbol, market_state, portfolio
        )
        
        # Modify decision based on your rules
        if self.my_custom_indicator(market_state) > threshold:
            decision.confidence *= 1.5
            
        return decision
```

### Backtesting

(Coming soon) Test strategies on historical data:

```python
backtester = KimeraBacktester(strategy, historical_data)
results = await backtester.run(
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-12-31"
)
```

## Safety & Best Practices

### Development

1. **Always use testnet first**
2. **Start with small position sizes**
3. **Monitor performance closely**
4. **Set conservative risk limits**

### Production

1. **Never commit API keys**
2. **Use read-only keys when possible**
3. **Implement additional safeguards**
4. **Regular performance audits**
5. **Have manual override capability**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing API credentials"**
   - Ensure .env file exists with valid keys
   - Check file permissions

2. **"Connection refused"**
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check if using correct endpoint (testnet vs mainnet)

3. **"Insufficient balance"**
   - Testnet requires manual faucet funding
   - Check account has USDT balance

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
