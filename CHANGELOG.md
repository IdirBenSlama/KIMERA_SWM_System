- Configuration file locations moved to `/config`
- Test file organization restructured
- API endpoint paths may have changed

### Migration Guide
1. Update all imports from `backend.*` to `src.*`
2. Move configuration files to `/config` directory
3. Update test imports and references
4. Review API documentation for endpoint changes
5. Run migration verification script
